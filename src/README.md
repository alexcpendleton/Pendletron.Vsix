This Visual Studio extension will open up the Source Control Explorer with the location of the currently-selected item in the Solution Explorer. It has been tested only with **Visual Studio 2010** and **TFS 2010**.

It was inspired by several extensions that have a "Locate in Solution Explorer" command which highlights the item you're working on in the Solution Explorer.

## What it looks like:
