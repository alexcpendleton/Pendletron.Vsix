#Locate in TFS - Visual Studio Extension (2010, 2012, 2013)
Opens up the Source Control Explorer window to the location of the currently selected file. This works from the Solution Explorer and from the active document.

It was inspired by several extensions that have a "Locate in Solution Explorer" command which highlights the item you're working on in the Solution Explorer.
